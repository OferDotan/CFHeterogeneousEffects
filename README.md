Master thesis project: "Using Causal Machine Learning to Explore Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: _a case study application to girls' empowerment programme in Africa_ by Ofer Dotan & Mariana Saldarriaga

Application of causal forest (grf. package) for the purpose of estimating treatment effect hetrogeneity to RCT data from an impact evaluation of a skill program to empower adolescent girls in Uganda (See Bandiera et al., 2014).


Methodology steps:
1. Run the file  "1.creation.do" on the data file "Uganda_ELA_Panel_wide" using STATA to generate necessary variables. 
2. Resulting data is called "Uganda_ELA_Panel_wide_creation"
3. Run pre processing
4. Main analysis folder: contain analysis of three outcomes
5. Linear replication: "Replication linear analysis"
6. Survey analysis folder: "Survey analysis" (analysis of survey distributed to experts in the field of impact evaluation and development)
7. Trials folder: contains supplemental analysis explored
